### Additional Notes

- Some models (like Gemini 1.5 Pro) require special enterprise access and may not have public pricing.
- GPT models often offer a discount (about 50%) for cached/repeated input tokens.
- Vision/image processing may incur additional costs ($2.50 to $15.00 per 1M tokens).
- Open-source models' costs are based on cloud compute estimates and will vary by deployment.
- For cost savings, consider model cascading (using cheaper models for filtering), token compression, and batch processing.
- Open-source models like LLaMA 4 and Mistral 8x22B are best for organizations that can manage their own infrastructure.
